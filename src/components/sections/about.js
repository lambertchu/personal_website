              I was born and raised on Long Island, New York. I studied computer science and
              management science at MIT. During my freshman year, I pitched on the varsity baseball
              team for a grand total of one inning (and thankfully didn&lsquo;t give up any runs

              During my senior year, I co-founded Point with two of my fraternity brothers. Our team
              built an NLP-powered product to help people write emails faster. We were funded by

              Since then, I have pursued my interests in technology, markets, sports, and web3. I
              worked in the front office of the New York Yankees as a member of the baseball
              operations department. I was an early core employee at startups Lucky Trader and Deca,
              where I helped analyze, design, and build NFT-based web3 games. I&lsquo;m also a
