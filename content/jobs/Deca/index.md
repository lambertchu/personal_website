At Deca, I'm helping to build infrastructure that brings NFTs to life. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

<br/>

- Built the image generation pipeline for the Decagon, our platform's membership token and art collection. The collection contains over 44,000 NFTs with a trading volume of 670 ETH ($870,000) as of October 2022
- Helped implement the Deca Experience (DXP) points system to gamify interactions on the Deca platform, resulting in major growth of daily user activity
- Built internal systems to identify and prevent DXP fraud and sybil attacks
